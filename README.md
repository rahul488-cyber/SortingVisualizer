# SortingVisualizer
This project is a Python-based Sorting Algorithm Visualizer that demonstrates various sorting algorithms, including Merge Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. It uses the Tkinter library to generate random arrays and visualize the sorting process with dynamic updates.



## Features
- Visualizes popular sorting algorithms.
- Adjustable speed control for sorting visualization (Fast, Medium, Slow).
- Displays time complexity for each selected algorithm.
- 
## Algorithms Supported:
- Merge Sort (O(nlogn))
- Selection Sort (O(n^2))
- Bubble Sort (O(n^2))
- Insertion Sort (O(n^2))
- Quick Sort (O(nlogn))
- Heap Sort (O(nlogn))
